1. Load in map data and spawn point
2. Convert map data to horizontal and vertical edges using xylines_to_edges from map_to_polygons
3. Find all line segment intersections and cut at all intersection points using intersect_and_cut from map_to_polygon
4. Remove doubles to create multiple polygons using remove_doubles from remove_doubles
5. Create contour vertices lists using detect_contours from detect_contours
6. Inflate contours
7. Run new intersect and cut, remove doubles
8. Create new contours

Done, have properly inflated contours of the map.
